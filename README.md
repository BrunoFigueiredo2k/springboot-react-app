# Fullstack practice apps (Spring Boot + React.js)
This repository is the place where I keep some of my personal projects for practicing fullstack webdevelopment using React.js on the frontend and Spring Boot on the backend. The projects I make are mostly simple CRUD applications that communicate with REST API's.

### Goals:
<ul>
  <li>Learning more about backend development in general, specifically Spring Boot framework.</li>
  <li>Learning more about MVC design pattern.</li>
  <li>Getting more comfortable with queries and databases, but also setting up my own REST API's and CRUD operations.</li>
  <li>Learning more about React concepts.</li>
</ul>

### Technologies used so far:
<ul>
  <li>Spring Boot (Java)</li>
  <li>React.js (Javascript)</li>
  <li>MySQL database (SQL)</li>
</ul>
